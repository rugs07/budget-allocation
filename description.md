## Proportional Budget Allocation Popup (React)

Build a visually appealing budget allocation popup for a cloud platform. The popup allows users to set a total budget and allocate it across four resources: CPU, GPU, Memory, and Other Services. Each resource is controlled by a slider with a modern, flat UI (no rounded corners).

**Requirements:**
- The user can set a total budget (number input).
- There are four sliders, one for each resource, each with a distinct color.
- The sum of all slider values cannot exceed the total budget.
- If the user tries to increase a slider beyond the remaining budget, the other sliders automatically decrease proportionally to make room.
- Display the remaining budget dynamically.

**Note:**
To attempt the solution, comment out the solution component import in `App.jsx` and uncomment the template component import. Implement your solution in the template file as instructed.
