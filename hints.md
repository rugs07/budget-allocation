- Use an object to store the allocation for each resource (e.g., { cpu, gpu, memory, otherservices }).
- When a slider changes, if the total would exceed the budget, reduce the other sliders proportionally to their current values.
- Use a flat, modern UI with no border-radius and clear color accents for each slider.
- Use React state and controlled components for all inputs.
- Reset all allocations to zero if the total budget changes.
