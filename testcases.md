1. Set total budget to 100. Set CPU=50, GPU=30, Memory=20, Other Services=0. Remaining budget should be 0.
2. Try to set GPU to 60 (when CPU=50, Memory=20, Other=0). CPU and Memory should decrease proportionally so the total remains 100.
3. Change total budget to 80. All allocations should reset to 0.
4. Set all sliders to 20 (total=80). Remaining budget should be 0.
5. Try to set one slider to the full budget (e.g., CPU=80). All other sliders should become 0.
